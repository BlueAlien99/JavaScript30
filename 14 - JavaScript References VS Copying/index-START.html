    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players;
    console.log(players, players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // players2[2] = 'BlueAlien';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log(players, players2);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const players3 = players.slice();
    players3[2] = 'BlueAlien';
    console.log(players, players3);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    players4[2] = 'BlueAlien';
    console.log(players, players4);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players];
    players5[2] = 'BlueAlien';
    console.log(players, players5);

    const players6 = Array.from(players);
    players6[2] = 'BlueAlien';
    console.log(players, players6);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    console.clear();

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    // person2.number = 99;
    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 20 });
    console.log(person, person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person};
    person4.number = 99;
    console.log(person, person4);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
